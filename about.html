        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Born and raised in vibrant Colombia, I've always been fascinated by
          the limitless possibilities of computer and web development.
          Self-taught and always eager to learn, I've spent countless hours
          honing my skills in this exciting field. <br />
          <br />
          Recently, I made the decision to pursue a degree in software
          engineering at Politecnico Gran Colombiano. It was a choice I made
          with great conviction after realizing I wanted to take my skills to
          the next level and become a professional in this field, and I've been
          working hard ever since to acquire the knowledge and expertise needed
          to excel in this dynamic industry. <br />
          <br />
          Although my journey in software engineering has just begun, I'm eager
          to take the next step in my career and put my skills to work in a
          professional setting. If you're in search of a dedicated and driven
          developer with a strong work ethic and a passion for excellence, I
          would be honored to hear from you.
